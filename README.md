## Project description: 
The Marcell Experimental Forest (MEF) in northern Minnesota is operated by the USDA Forest Service and was established in 1962 to study the ecology and hydrology of peatlands. The Fellow will work with streamflow data gathered at 5-minute resolution by environmental sensors in six catchments instrumented for hydrologic monitoring within the 1100-hectare experimental forest. The Fellow will develop scripted workflows in R to organize raw data, document the transition from mechanical to electronic sensors, and optionally write Python code to display the data within a visually appealing online data dashboard. The Fellow will publish two new data packages in EDI. 

This project is part of the [Environmental Data Initiative's](https://environmentaldatainitiative.org/) [2022 Data Data Management Fellowship Program](https://environmentaldatainitiative.org/2022-dm-fellowship-program/). 

## Project motivation and goals: 
The overall goals of this project include: 
- Combining, cleaning, and visualizing multiple water years worth of streamflow data (specifically, stream height) from the MEF S2 bog site 
- Incorporating climate data (such as air temperature and precipitation), bogwell data (AKA peatland water table elevation), and old sensor data to cross-validate the streamflow data's accuracy 
- Publishing the cleaned streamflow data in the [EDI Data Portal](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/home.jsp)

Ultimately, this project aims to facilitate the transition away from older analogue data collection techniques such as paper stripcharts that must be digitized by hand towards newer data collection techniques such as shaft encoder sensors. 

## Data
Data used in this project are proprietary to the USDA Forest Service and stored in a private, online Box server used by the Marcell Experimental Forest team. For data access, please contact Dr. Nina Lany. 

## Tools
This project primarily uses R and RStudio.
