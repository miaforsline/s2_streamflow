# Marcell Experimental Forest S2 Bog Site Streamflow Analysis 
### Author: Mia Forsline
### Project dates: June 21 - August 19, 2022 

## Project description: 
The Marcell Experimental Forest (MEF) in northern Minnesota is operated by the USDA Forest Service and was established in 1962 to study the ecology and hydrology of peatlands. The Fellow will work with streamflow data gathered at 5-minute resolution by environmental sensors in six catchments instrumented for hydrologic monitoring within the 1100-hectare experimental forest. The Fellow will develop scripted workflows in R to organize raw data, document the transition from mechanical to electronic sensors, and optionally write Python code to display the data within a visually appealing online data dashboard. The Fellow will publish two new data packages in EDI. On-site accommodations include high-speed internet, laundry, and kitchen, as well as nearby hiking trails and lakes.

This project is part of the [Environmental Data Initiative's](https://environmentaldatainitiative.org/) [2022 Data Data Management Fellowship Program](https://environmentaldatainitiative.org/2022-dm-fellowship-program/).
